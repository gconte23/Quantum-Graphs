# Quantum Graph Package Readme

This code is written as a MATLAB [_Project_](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/project-management.html). In order to run it, first type
```>> openProject QGObject.prj``` 
at the MATLAB prompt or else click on the file `QGObject.prj` in the file listing on the left. This will open up a project window. This does two things that allow you to run the codes.

1. Set the paths.
2. Change some plotting defaults. The users defaults are saved in a `tmp` directory and are restored when the user closes the project by closing the project window.

There's some documentation:

Basic instructions are in a matlab live script `quantumGraphRoutines.mlx`, which has also been saved as an [html file](quantumGraphRoutines.html).

Some additional examples are in live scripts in directories `source/examples`, and `documentation`.
